# Assignment 2 of Mobile Application Development course

Gallery-like application that allows you to upload images from the network and show a fullscreen view of the selected image
I have used an [open API with dogs](https://dog.ceo/dog-api) for this assignment


## Main screen:

At the top of the screen, there is a search bar in which you could change the request option.
User types the breed name there
All space below used for gallery view (Recycler View + Grid Layout Manager + Adapter) 
Depending on the breed, the images of dogs are displayed

## Details screen:
Fullscreen view which contains only well-sized image selected by User
There is also a button to go back to gallery view
